## Overview
The **Weather Forecast App** provides accurate and up-to-date weather information for your current location or a selected city. With a user-friendly interface and robust architecture, the app ensures a seamless experience for weather updates.

## Features
- **Today Fragment**:
  - Displays the current location's temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- **Week Fragment**:
  - Provides a 7-day weather forecast, including key details for each day.
- **Settings Fragment**:
  - Allows users to:
      - Switch between Metric and Imperial units.
      - Customize the app's theme (Light/Dark).
      - Search for and update the weather for different cities.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**:
  - Quick navigation between Today, Week, and Settings fragments.

## Tech Stack
  - **Java**: Core language for development.
  - **XML**: Designed the responsive and intuitive UI.
  - **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures scalability, separation of concerns, and maintainability.
  - **Retrofit**: Used for fetching weather data via RESTful APIs.
  - **Glide**: Efficiently loads and displays weather-related images.

## Screens
### 1. Today Fragment
- Displays real-time weather data:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Weather condition

### 2. Week Fragment

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project on an emulator or physical device.

## API Integration
The app fetches weather data using a weather API. Ensure you add your API key in the `build.gradle` or `local.properties` file:
```gradle
API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## Dependencies
Here are the major libraries used in this project:
- **Dagger Hilt**: Dependency Injection
- **Retrofit**: REST API integration
- **Glide**: Image loading and processing

Add the following dependencies to your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation "com.google.dagger:hilt-android:<version>"
kapt "com.google.dagger:hilt-compiler:<version>"
implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:<version>"
implementation "com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:<version>"
kapt "com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:<version>"
```

## Architecture
The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture:
- **Model**: Manages data, including API calls using Retrofit.
- **View**: UI components, including fragments for Today, Week, and Settings.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between Model and View, ensuring clean separation of concerns.

## How to Use
1. Launch the app.
2. Use the bottom navigation bar to switch between Today, Week, and Settings fragments.
3. In the Today fragment, view real-time weather data.
4. In the Week fragment, explore the 7-day forecast.
5. In the Settings fragment:
   - Change the theme.
   - Search for and select a city to update the weather data.
